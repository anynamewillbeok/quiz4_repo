   * way to do it.  The third argument to init() is the name of the node.
   *
   * You must call one of the versions of ros::init() before using any other
   * part of the ROS system.
   *
   * The third argument below "week10" is the rosnode name
   * The name must be unique, only one node of the same name can ever register with the roscore
   * If a rosnode with same name exists, it will be terminated
